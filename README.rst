Projects aimed at deriving empirical constraints of the tidal dissipation in stars:
  * Constraints from tidal synchronization in open cluster binaries
  * Constraints from tidal inspiral of exoplanet systems
  * Constraints from tidal circularization of open cluster binary stars
  * Constraints from tidal circularization of exoplanet systems 

Potentially interesting systems:
  * `The Curious Case of KOI 4: Confirming Kepler's First Exoplanet <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190301591C/abstract>`_
