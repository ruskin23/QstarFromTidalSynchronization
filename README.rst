Projects aimed at deriving empirical constraints of the tidal dissipation in stars:
  * Constraints from tidal synchronization in open cluster binaries
  * Constraints from tidal inspiral of exoplanet systems
  * Constraints from tidal circularization of open cluster binary stars
  * Constraints from tidal circularization of exoplanet systems 

Potentially interesting systems:
  * `The Curious Case of KOI 4: Confirming Kepler's First Exoplanet <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190301591C/abstract>`_

Articles measuring spins in open clusters:
  * `K2 rotation periods for low-mass Hyads and a quantitative comparison of the distribution of slow rotators in the Hyades and Praesepe <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190506736D/abstract>`_
  * `A Temporary Epoch of Stalled Spin-Down for Low-Mass Stars: Insights from NGC 6811 with Gaia and Kepler  <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190506869C/abstract>`_
