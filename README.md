# ConstrainingQstar

Projects aimed at deriving empirical constraints of the tidal dissipation in stars:
  * Constraints from tidal synchronization in open cluster binaries
  * Constraints from tidal inspiral of exoplanet systems
  * Constraints from tidal circularization of open cluster binary stars
  * Constraints from tidal circularization of exoplanet systems
