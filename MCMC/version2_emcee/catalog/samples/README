These .npz files contain the thinned (few x 10^4) version of chains from the full MCMC analysis, typically 128 walkers x ~100-1500k iterations. You can open the files in Python using Numpy with the np.load() function. 

Each file contains:

'thinned_chain' : 2d array sampling a few x 10^4 data points from full mcmc
'thinned_by' : int specifying the numerical factor in thinning
